Unstructured and Uninterpretable Computer Programs (or, my SICP workbook)

> Do not labor under the illusion that this is a text digestible at
> MIT only, peculiar to the breed found there. It is precisely what a
> serious book on programming Lisp must be, no matter who the student
> is or where it is used.
> — Alan J. Perlis, [SICP Foreword](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-5.html#%25_chap_Temp_2)

> You must do the exercises to get the most out of SICP. Reading will
> not suffice. Videos will not suffice. Putting on a wizard cape will
> not suffice. Only doing the exercises will bring lasting shifts to
> how you see and understand code.
